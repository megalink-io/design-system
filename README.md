# Megalink Design System

The Megalink Design System powers our frontend apps. It contains reusable UI components that help us build complex, durable, and accessible user interfaces across our projects.

## Install

The code is delivered as an NPM package:

```bash
npm install @megalink/design-system
```

## Use

Add an alias for the package path to the `compilerOptions` of your `tsconfig.json` to make the imports shorter and clearer:

```json
"baseUrl": ".",
"paths": {
  "@mds/*": ["node_modules/@megalink/design-system/dist/*"]
}
```

> As long as `creat-react-app` does not support the `paths` property in `tsconfig.json`, the following workaround must be used: [https://github.com/oklas/react-app-rewire-alias](https://github.com/oklas/react-app-rewire-alias)

You can then import icons or components:

```tsx
import { HouseSVG } from '@mds/icons';
import { IconButton } from '@mds/components/basic/actions';
```

## Dependencies

The following peer dependencies are required:

```json
"react": ">= 16.13.0",
"react-dom": ">= 16.13.0",
"react-router-dom": ">= 5.1.0",
