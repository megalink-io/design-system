# Typography

Typography plays an important role in creating user interfaces. With the help of well thought-out headlines and texts, users find their way around more quickly and easily.

In a design system it is therefore extremely important to define typography rules to create a consistent experience across platforms.

## Typefaces

In our design system the font [Poppins](https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/poppins/) is used. It is available under the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).

## Components

### Title

A title represents the main heading of a page and should therefore appear only once per page.
