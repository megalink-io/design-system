# Typography

Typography plays an important role in creating user interfaces. With the help of well thought-out headlines and texts, users find their way around more quickly and easily.

In a design system it is therefore extremely important to define typography rules to create a consistent experience across platforms.

## Typefaces

In our design system the font [Poppins](https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/poppins/) is used. It is available under the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).

## Components

### Title

A title represents the main heading of a page and should therefore appear only once per page.

<RouterAndTheme>
  <Title>Example text</Title>
</RouterAndTheme>

### Heading

A heading is the main heading of a section and should therefore appear only once per section.

<RouterAndTheme>
  <Heading>Example text</Heading>
</RouterAndTheme>

### Subheading

A subheading divides the content of a section and can appear as often as you like.

<RouterAndTheme>
  <Subheading>Example text</Subheading>
</RouterAndTheme>

### Paragraph

A paragraph represents a block of text and can appear as often as you like.

<RouterAndTheme>
  <Paragraph>Example text</Paragraph>
</RouterAndTheme>

### Detail

A detail is a side note or small description and can appear as often as you like.

<RouterAndTheme>
  <Detail>Example text</Detail>
</RouterAndTheme>

export const RouterAndTheme = ({ children }) => (
  <Canvas>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Theme>{children}</Theme>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Canvas>
);
